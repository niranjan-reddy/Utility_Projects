# Counter Application

## About:
This is a Java Swing Application for counting the number of items those you locate on a differnt place.

## Background / Motivation:
I am an avid identifier of things I know among the list of stuff I find online. e.g., While reading alien movies list on Wikipedia, I count those movies I either know or have watched already. While doing so, I lose track of them. To get over this issue, I built this application.

Since this is a Swing Application which runs in its own window, I can keep clicking the numeric keys while reading (and scrolling) the Wikipedia or IMDB or any other website.

## Upcoming:
Next version would have the updates as follow:
> Exit/Close button in the bottom
> Subject input field
> Save Option / button
> Save functionality to new file or existing file (append)
> Export functionality to XLS or PDF
> Email functionality of the content of file or as attachment
